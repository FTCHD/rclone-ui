# Issue & Goal
- opening the app in release mode does not show the tray icon or do anything
- tauri looks to be working and sending the `applicationDidFinishLaunching` event but nothing happens
- the goal is to have this run on macOS (no sandboxing needed)


# Notes
### Overall
- you will have to download the `rclone` binary from the [website](https://rclone.org/downloads/) yourself. if you already have rclone installed, it will be used instead of the binary.
- the main window runs the `main.ts` file that's at the project root, it is not related to the vite app. it gets compiled by the `buildExternal.js` script and added to the vite bundle through the `public` directory.
- sometimes `rclone` binary does not start correctly and the loading tray icons is stuck forever, i'd like to solve that too but this is more of a notice to restart the app if that happens.
